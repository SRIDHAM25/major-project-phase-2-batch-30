The GLA Act also created four criminal offences, arising from the licensing scheme, of operating as an unlicensed gangmaster; entering into arrangements with an unlicensed gangmaster; obstructing GLA officers; and having false documentation.The Immigration Act 2016 determined that GLA should have a broader role in tackling labour exploitation and be renamed as the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA).  New powers to investigate labour market offences in England and Wales were given including the ability to investigate national minimum wage, employment agencies and modern slavery offences; these commenced on 30 April 2017.
